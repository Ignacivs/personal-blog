# Preambule
Dark Angels are one of my favourite armies, they combine everything I like about Space Marines. Plasma weapons that overheat and kill their users, unleashing small super-nova explosions uppon your foes, and tough Terminators that are movable brick walls that stand vigil and refuse to die no matter the odds. They truly are an army that is all about last stands, and that really makes my gears spin. So without further ado here are all my Dark Angel lists, with strategies on how to use them. Mostly these lists will be up to date and I will be changing them as I realise what works and what does not, hope you find the useful!
